#CS61HUEHUE CODE

So there's several parts to this:
CS61huehue: the program that sits on your computer and generates many accounts. Then it waits for what to display. 
CS61huehueApp: What you put on your phone to talk to the server 
ServerFiles: What is on the server. This will need heavy work, as the threads across multiple computers will need to be coordinated by this script.
